# DrawingApp
This is a simple drawing app for Android, built using Kotlin.

## How It's Made:
I used Kotlin in Android Studio to make this app.


## Lessons Learned:
In this project, I learned about "paths" and using the drawing libraries in Android Studio. 
This was in introduction to using touch events and saving image files to a mobile device.

## Things to improve:
I would fix the "share" function, which doesn't seem to work properly (it seems to be due to the file type which the drawing is saved as).
